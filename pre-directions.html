              <p class="">
                In this activity, you will be exploring a topic related to tests and technology 
                (for example, how technology is used to design, deliver, or support tests and assessment).
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1 mt-3">
              <p>
                You will have access to three types of learning materials:
                <ul>
                  <li>4 short videos about tests and technology </li>
                  <li>4 concept maps related to the topic</li>
                  <li>4 practice problems you can try to solve</li>
                </ul>
                
                You are free to choose what to view, in what order, and for how long.
                You can move back and forth between videos, concept maps, and problems as much as you like. 
                There is no time limit and no single <strong>“correct”</strong> way to complete the activity.

                The purpose of this activity is not to test you, but to help us better understand how students interact with 
                online learning materials. We are interested in general patterns, such as how learners navigate between resources and how they choose to use different types of materials..
